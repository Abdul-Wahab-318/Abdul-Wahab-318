### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Abdul Wahab, a 5th semester software engineering student from Air University, Islamabad. Since 2021, I have been gaining hands-on experience in MERN Stack development by learning from various resources and developing custom projects according to industrial standards, with a particular focus on software development. Moreover, I have been freelancing on fiverr and building web apps for clients across the world.

Crafting ideas into web-based realities is my forte, which enables me to possess the following skills:
â€¢ Front-End: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React.js, Redux, Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS
â€¢ Back-End: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and REST APIs
â€¢ Tools: Postman and GitHub
